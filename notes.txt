6.17_gcc-5.2.0
one test under libstdc++ section, conformance.exp, took like 1/2 hour! Just
sat there, cursor blinking but doing nothing else! All good though,
eventually continued on.
unknown test failed (will check logs and update)
This was weird, because it seems like all of the tests passed, but at the
very beginning of the log there is "autogen: Command not found" followed
by some error alerts but little or no explanation.
